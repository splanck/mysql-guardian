MySQL Guardian Installation Instructions
----------------------------------------

MySQL Guardian is currently a work in progress. There are future plans to create packages
for various Linux distributions to simplify the installation process, but at the moment
building the binary from source and manually configuring the service is required. This
document provides a brief explanation of the steps required to get the service running
on a Linux system using the Systemd init system.

NOTE: MySQL Guardian requires a MySQL database server to store data required for performing
monitoring tasks. Be sure to have MySQL or MariaDB installed prior to install MySQL Guardian.

Download and Install MySQL Guardian
-----------------------------------

Download and setup MySQL Guardian using the following steps:

1. Clone the git repository to download the source tree using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/splanck/mysql-guardian.git

2. Ensure you have the ncurses and MySQL development libraries installed on your system.

Use the following command to install both libraries on an Arch based distibution:

sudo pacman -S libmariadbclient lib32-ncurses

Use the following command on a Debian based distribution:

sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libncurses-dev

Use the following command on a RHEL or CentOS distribution:

sudo yum install mysql-devel ncurses-devel

3. Goto the mysql-guardian/src directory and build the source using the following command:

make -B

4. Install the service using the following command:

sudo make install

5. Run the mysql-guardian command from the mysql-guardian/build folder to generate a config file and create the required database
using the following command:

sudo ./mysql-guardian --init

6. Emter the hostname, root username, and password for the MySQL instance you want to use
to store the mysql-guardian database. This database is where all monitoring data will be
stored. The require database and tables will then be created on the specified server.

7. Start the MySQL Guardian service using Systemd with the following command:

sudo systemctl start mysqlgd

8. If you would like MySQL Guardian to start when your system boots, use the following
command to enable the service:

sudo systemctl enable mysqlgd

Configuring MySQL Guardian
--------------------------

MySQL Guardian can be configured by editing the /etc/mysqlgd.conf file. This file is
generated when you run the binary with the --init parameter and allows you to configure
the monitoring server used by Guardian as well as the various checks it performs. Changing
the default values in the file will change the intervals in which each check will be
performed. These intervals are specified in seconds. You will need to restart the mysqlgd
service for any configuration changes to take effect.

Uninstall Instructions
----------------------

You can uninstall MySQL Guardian by using the following command from the src directory:

sudo make uninstall

You may also want to drop the mysql_guardian database from your MySQL or MariaDB database
server by executing the following query:

DROP DATABASE mysql_guardian;
